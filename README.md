# ABC Frontend Coding Exercise

## Summary

This is my submission for ABC's coding exercise. I spent around 1.5 days working on it.

Please see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for more information on tech decisions and what I would aim to achieve with more time.

## Getting Started

Run these commands to get the app running.

Please note that the modified code can be found on the `dylan-keyt-code-submission` branch. This was done in order to have an easier time viewing differences to `master`.

```
git clone https://github.com/dylan-keyt/abcdigital.git
cd abcdigital
git checkout dylan-keyt-code-submission
npm install
npm start
```
